             HTML is a programming language that stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This is a relatively simplistic yet powerful programming language that allows web develops and website owners to create the structure of their website. If you want a sentence in a blog post to receive a bold font, HTML could be used to achieve this. When using this system, any text files can be tagged for effects, graphics, fonts, or colors. If you’ve never used any kind of programming language in the past, HTML would be a great place to start. Keep in mind that HTML markups are enhanced by CSS and JavaScript, which is why it’s recommended that you learn this programming language first.

            <p class="content">Even though CSS is primarily used to create static visual effects, the latest versions of the programming language offer some functionality for the creation of very simple animations.

If you want to change the color of some of the text on a web page, basic CSS would allow you to do so by adding “style” code to the HTML code that’s already found on your page.
Along with the presentation of HTML, CSS can also be used to alter the layout and formatting of your website.
Once you know the basics of CSS, you should be capable of improving the look of your website and all of the HTML that you have already added to the design..</p>

            <p class="content">JavaScript is among the most important programming languages for website owners who want to make their site more interactive, which makes this the most complex of the three standard programming languages in this article. While HTML provides the structure for a website and CSS allows you to control the presentation of a site, the JavaScript programming language gives you the tools that you need to alter the behavior of different elements that are found on a website page. With this tool, you can add a layer of interactivity to the CSS and HTML elements on your website, which is highly recommended if you want your website to appeal to the modern customer.</p>
